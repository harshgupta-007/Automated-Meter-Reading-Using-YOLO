Automatic instrument reading has become an increasingly essential problem for intelligent sensors in smart cities.
Thanks to the rapid development of artificial intelligence and fifth-generation mobile network technologies. 
In this paper, we propose an end-to-end AMR strategy that focuses on unconstrained settings also we have created our own dataset of cropped images of counter. 
Existing image-based Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) techniques have been tested on images captured in well-controlled situations.
Existing approaches become unresponsive when dealing with fuzzy, hazy, or blurry meter images.
We have used two main components to our meter reading system: 
i) You Only Look Once (YOLO) is used to identify counter region,
ii) Digit Detection using YOLO. 
Using the method provided here, it is possible to reliably detect and recognise different meter kinds. 
Furthermore, because real-world applications accept a few reading errors, we show that our AMR system achieves remarkable recognition rates of 99% even while rejecting readings with lower confidence values.
